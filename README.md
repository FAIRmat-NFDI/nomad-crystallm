# nomad-crystallm

`nomad-crystallm` is a NOMAD plugin that can be used to run inference of
[CrystaLLM](https://crystallm.com/) models and create entries based on the generated CIFs.



## Development

If you want to develop locally this plugin, clone the project and in the plugin folder, create a virtual environment (you can use Python 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-crystallm.git
cd nomad-crystallm
python3.11 -m venv .pyenv
. .pyenv/bin/activate
```

Make sure to have `pip` upgraded:
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```

We recommend installing `uv` for fast pip installation of the packages:
```sh
pip install uv
```

Install the `nomad-lab` package:
```sh
uv pip install -e '.[dev]'
```
### Developing on `nomad-distro-dev`
We now recommend using the dedicated
[`nomad-distro-dev`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-distro-dev)
repository to simplify the process. Please refer to that repository for
detailed instructions on how to add this plugin to your development environment.

This plugin relies on some new developments in `nomad-lab` package that are
currently available in a feature branch. To use it in your `nomad-distro-dev`,
you have to change the branch of the `nomad-lab` sub-module available at
`packages/nomad-FAIR` to the feature branch:
```sh
# assuming you are in the root of your nomad-distro-dev repo
cd packages/nomad-FAIR
git checkout temporal-workflows
cd -
```

Further, you need to modify `nomad.yaml` config file to contain the following
table:
```yaml
temporal:
  enabled: true
```

We use [temporal](https://temporal.io/) as a workflow scheduler to run the
inference pipeline. For this, you will need temporal container configurations
in `docker-compose.yaml`, which should be available once you update your
`nomad-distro-dev` fork. Specifically, here are the required changes: https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-distro-dev/commit/16e6129c43d9e6d56f2ff5a92c041c88a6a2eac2.

With these changes in place, make sure to run `uv run poe setup` to reset
the environment.

Finally, you can run your local installation with `uv run poe start` and
`uv run poe gui start` in separate terminals. Additionally, start a temporal
worker in a third terminal using `uv run nomad admin run orchestrator-gpu-worker`.

### Run the tests

You can run locally the tests:
```sh
python -m pytest -sv tests
```

where the `-s` and `-v` options toggle the output verbosity.

Our CI/CD pipeline produces a more comprehensive test report using the `pytest-cov` package. You can generate a local coverage report:
```sh
uv pip install pytest-cov
python -m pytest --cov=src tests
```

### Run linting and auto-formatting

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting the code. Ruff auto-formatting is also a part of the GitHub workflow actions. You can run locally:
```sh
ruff check .
ruff format . --check
```

### Debugging

For interactive debugging of the tests, use `pytest` with the `--pdb` flag. We recommend using an IDE for debugging, e.g., _VSCode_. If that is the case, add the following snippet to your `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
  "configurations": [
      {
        "name": "<descriptive tag>",
        "type": "debugpy",
        "request": "launch",
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/.pyenv/bin/pytest",
        "justMyCode": true,
        "env": {
            "_PYTEST_RAISE": "1"
        },
        "args": [
            "-sv",
            "--pdb",
            "<path-to-plugin-tests>",
        ]
    }
  ]
}
```

where `<path-to-plugin-tests>` must be changed to the local path to the test module to be debugged.

The settings configuration file `.vscode/settings.json` automatically applies the linting and formatting upon saving the modified file.

### Documentation on Github pages

To view the documentation locally, install the related packages using:
```sh
uv pip install -r requirements_docs.txt
```

Run the documentation server:
```sh
mkdocs serve
```

## Adding this plugin to NOMAD

Currently, NOMAD has two distinct flavors that are relevant depending on your role as an user:
1. [A NOMAD Oasis](#adding-this-plugin-in-your-nomad-oasis): any user with a NOMAD Oasis instance.
2. [Local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD](#adding-this-plugin-in-your-local-nomad-installation-and-the-source-code-of-nomad): internal developers.

### Adding this plugin in your NOMAD Oasis

Read the [NOMAD plugin documentation](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/howto/oasis/plugins_install.html) for all details on how to deploy the plugin on your NOMAD instance.

### Adding this plugin in your local NOMAD installation and the source code of NOMAD

We now recommend using the dedicated [`nomad-distro-dev`](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nomad-distro-dev) repository to simplify the process. Please refer to that repository for detailed instructions.

### Template update

We use [`cruft`](https://github.com/cruft/cruft) to update the project based on template changes. To run the check for updates locally, run `cruft update` in the root of the project. More details see the instructions on [`cruft` website](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/#updating-a-project).
